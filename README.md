In automotive engineering, the precise modeling of tire-road interactions is crucial for optimizing vehicle dynamics such as handling, safety, and performance. At the heart of these interactions lies the friction coefficient, a variable parameter significantly influenced by contact pressure, sliding velocity, surface texture, and environmental conditions. This project focuses on advancing the accuracy of friction model parameter estimations, essential for simulating tire behavior under diverse operational conditions. To enhance the estimation processes, we evaluated the performance of five different friction models: the Heumer model, Lupker model, Wriggers model (2006), Dorsch model (2002), and Wriggers and Reinelt model (2009). Each model was subjected to a series of optimization techniques, with the objective of minimizing the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and maximizing R-squared values, critical metrics for assessing model accuracy and fit. Among the optimization methods tested, Differential Evolution emerged as the standout technique, consistently yielding the lowest MAPE and highest R-squared values across the board. Furthermore, to efficiently handle the computational demands of multiple models, we employed advanced parallel computing techniques within our Python framework. This integration allowed for the concurrent execution and optimization of all models based on user-provided inputs for slip velocity (VT) and pressure (PN). The system was structured to automatically identify and recommend the model that exhibited the least MAPE, thus enhancing the predictive accuracy of our simulations. This approach not only streamlines the process of model selection but also significantly impacts the design and safety optimization of automotive vehicles, leading to improved performance in real-world conditions.
The outcomes of this project highlight the potential for these refined models to be integrated into broader automotive systems, potentially influencing everything from autonomous vehicle algorithms to predictive maintenance frameworks. Looking forward, the integration of more complex environmental variables and real-time data could further enhance the models' accuracy and applicability. This progression towards more dynamic and adaptive modeling frameworks is expected to drive significant advancements in automotive technology, contributing to safer, more efficient, and environmentally friendly transportation solutions. The methodologies and insights derived from this study not only pave the way for future research in tire dynamics but also open avenues for the practical application of these models in vehicle design and road safety analysis.
